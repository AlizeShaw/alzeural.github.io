## Branching and Merging

Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to work on different versions of your code at the same time.

### Creating a Branch

To create a new branch, you can use the `git branch` command, followed by the name of your new branch.

### Merging Branches

Once you are happy with the changes in a branch, you can merge them into another branch (such as the `main` branch).
