Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models combine the power of retrieval mechanisms with generative language models. They enable AI to access external knowledge sources while generating contextually accurate responses.

This hybrid approach improves performance on tasks requiring factual correctness and enhances the ability of AI systems to answer questions that go beyond their pre-trained knowledge. RAG models are shaping the future of intelligent, knowledge-aware AI.
