## Introduction to Java

Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language that is used to build a wide variety of applications.

### Why Learn Java?

*   **Platform Independent:** Java is a "write once, run anywhere" language, meaning that you can write your code once and it will run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*   **Large Community:** Java has a large and active community, which means that there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and troubleshoot.
